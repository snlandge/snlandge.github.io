# Exploring Federalism and Innovation at the APPAM Annual Conference 2024

This November, I had the privilege of attending the **APPAM Annual Fall Research Conference 2024** in National Harbor, Maryland. With the theme, **“Policymaking at the Federal, State, and Local Levels,”** the conference brought together over 3,000 attendees, including policymakers, academics, industry professionals, and students. It provided a vibrant platform to explore the complexities of policymaking in a federal system and the innovative approaches to addressing pressing societal challenges.

## A Theme Rooted in Federalism  
The conference theme underscored the importance of understanding how policies interact across different levels of government. Discussions revolved around key questions such as:  
- How do federal programs impact diverse localities differently?  
- What is the optimal government level for funding and delivering public services?  
- How can federal and local governments collaborate effectively?  

Sessions like **“Equitable Access to Unemployment Insurance: A Story of Federal and State Collaboration”** and **“Advancing Equity and Efficiency in Electrification: Investment, Poverty, and Policy”** demonstrated the relevance of these questions with cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

## Presidential Address: Insights from Donald Moynihan  
A highlight of the conference was the **Presidential Address** delivered by **Donald Moynihan** from the University of Michigan. His talk, titled *State Capacity and Public Policy*, delved into how state and local governments can bolster their capacity to implement effective public policies. Moynihan emphasized the importance of institutional resilience and intergovernmental collaboration, offering a powerful perspective on navigating the challenges of governance in complex, multilevel systems.

## Plenary Panel: A Preview of Policy Under the Trump Administration  
Another standout session was the **Plenary Panel Discussion**, moderated by **Ingrid Gould Ellen**, APPAM President-Elect and a professor at New York University. The panel, titled *Policy Analysis and Management Under a Trump Administration,* provided a provocative preview of the shifts in policies and management expected under the administration.  

The distinguished panel included:  
- **Richard Burkhauser** (Civitas Institute, University of Texas)  
- **Donald Moynihan** (University of Michigan)  
- **Kosali Simon** (Indiana University)  
- **Christina Yancey** (American Institutes for Research)  

Discussions touched on the anticipated transformations in public management, health, social policy, workforce policy, and evaluation, informed by insights from the first Trump term. The session illuminated the unorthodox approaches of the administration and their implications for the public policy and research communities over the next four years.

## My Role as a Student Ambassador  

Serving as a **Student Ambassador** at the APPAM Annual Conference 2024 was an incredible honor and a memorable part of my experience. It was especially gratifying to be recognized with the **2024 APPAM Student Ambassador Award**, presented in acknowledgment of accomplishments and potential for a bright future. This recognition reinforced my dedication to contributing to the field of public policy and engaging with the broader research community.  

As a Student Ambassador, I had the opportunity to facilitate discussions, assist attendees, and represent the student voice at one of the most prestigious public policy conferences. This role deepened my engagement with the APPAM community and provided invaluable insights into public policy research and implementation.

## The Path Ahead  
Attending the APPAM Annual Conference has been a transformative experience, deepening my understanding of policymaking in a federal context and reinforcing my commitment to impactful research. The theme’s focus on federalism reminded us that effective policy design and implementation require a nuanced understanding of governance at all levels.

For those considering attending in the future, this conference is an unparalleled opportunity to learn, network, and explore the intersection of research and policymaking.
