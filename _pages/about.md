<a><strong>Hello!</strong></a> Iâ€™m Swapnil Landge, a PhD Candidate in Economics at [The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/). I am also an adjunct lecturer at [Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) and [Brooklyn College's Murray Koppelman School of Business](https://www.brooklyn.edu/). My research spans intergenerational occupational mobility, income inequality, labor economics, and applied microeconomics, with a focus on how these areas intersect to shape economic outcomes.
