**Hello!** I’m **Swapnil Landge**, a PhD Candidate in Economics at [The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/). I also serve as an adjunct lecturer at [Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) and [Brooklyn College's Murray Koppelman School of Business](https://www.brooklyn.edu/).

My research spans **intergenerational occupational mobility**, **income inequality**, **labor economics**, **applied microeconomics**, and **microeconometrics**. I focus on how these areas intersect to shape economic outcomes.

Currently, I am working on my dissertation under the supervision of [Professor Miles Corak](https://milescorak.com/about/). I use a combination of econometric methods and machine learning to develop self-selection models that explore how parental occupations influence children’s career choices and income inequality.

In addition to research, I am passionate about teaching and have designed and taught multiple undergraduate economics courses.
