<a><strong>Hello!</strong></a> I’m Swapnil Landge, a PhD Candidate in Economics at [The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/). I am also an adjunct lecturer at [Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) and [Brooklyn College's Murray Koppelman School of Business](https://www.brooklyn.edu/). My research spans intergenerational occupational mobility, income inequality, labor economics, Applied Microeconomics, and Applied Econometrics with a focus on how these areas intersect to shape economic outcomes.

I am currently working on my dissertation under the supervision of [Professor Miles Corak](https://milescorak.com/about/). My research utilizes econometric methods and machine learning models to examine self-selection across occupations. I develop models to explore how parental occupations influence children’s career choices and income inequality, aiming to deepen our understanding of occupational mobility and its broader economic implications.

In addition to my research, I teach economics courses, which allows me to share my passion for the field with students.

Explore my work on the [Research]([link to research page](https://snlandge.github.io/projects/)) and [Publications]([link to publications page](https://snlandge.github.io/publications/)) pages. For collaborations or inquiries, please view my [CV]([link to CV](https://snlandge.github.io/cv/)) or reach out through email.
