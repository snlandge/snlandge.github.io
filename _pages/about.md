**Hello!** I’m **Swapnil Landge**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/). I also teach undergraduate courses in economics at [Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) and [Brooklyn College’s Murray Koppelman School of Business](https://www.brooklyn.edu/).

My research investigates how **skills and occupations are transmitted across generations** and how these patterns shape **earnings inequality** and **economic mobility**. I specialize in **labor economics**, **applied microeconometrics**, and **machine learning methods** for causal inference and prediction.

Under the supervision of [Professor Miles Corak](https://milescorak.com/about/), my dissertation develops self-selection and machine-learning frameworks to examine how parental occupations and skills influence children’s career trajectories and income outcomes in the United States.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to teaching and curriculum design. I have independently taught multiple undergraduate courses—including *Labor Economics*, *Microeconomics*, *Macroeconomics*, and *Business Statistics*—with a focus on **inclusive pedagogy** and **empirical engagement**.
