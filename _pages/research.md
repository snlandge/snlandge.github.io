### *Intergenerational Transmission of Occupational Skills in the U.S.: A Machine Learning Analysis of Fathersâ€™ Skills and Childrenâ€™s Career Outcomes*  
[ðŸ“„ View Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZLXEJ62HtWZUdsKd4qTyatrnYCL0KD8/view?usp=drive_link){:target="_blank"}

This paper shows that fathersâ€™ occupational skills have distinct and systematic effects on childrenâ€™s career outcomes using a **multinomial logistic regression (MLogit)** framework and **machine learning models with SHAP interpretability**.  
- Fathers' **Technical skills** increase childrenâ€™s likelihood of entering service occupations and skilled labor while reducing entry into office and administrative tracks.  
- **Analytical skills** exert the strongest single effect, raising entry into office and administrative roles by over one percentage pointâ€”a four-percent increase relative to baseline predicted probability.  
- **Communication and problem-solving skills** channel children into education, healthcare, and transport, reflecting the interpersonal and operational demands of these sectors.  
- **Management skills** reinforce persistence in business and managerial pathways but reduce entry into transportation.

While the average marginal effects appear modest in absolute size, their proportional impact relative to baseline occupational probabilities is substantial.  
**Key takeaway:** Skillsâ€”not only credentials or parental resourcesâ€”are the key currency of occupational inheritance.

### *Legacy of Labor: The Impact of Parental Jobs on Childrenâ€™s Career Choices and Income Inequality*  
*Journal of Applied Econometrics*  
[ðŸ“„ View Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5083029){:target="_blank"}

This paper introduces a novel empirical model of occupational self-selection that integrates the **Roy model** with **Becker and Tomesâ€™s theory of intergenerational transmission**. The key innovation is modeling innate skills using a **bivariate FrÃ©chet distribution**, allowing for asymmetric, parent-influenced skill inheritance.

The main finding reveals that a significant proportion of children from middle- and low-income backgrounds are **negatively self-selected** into their parentsâ€™ occupationsâ€”meaning they would have been more productive and earned higher wages in other fields. Specifically:  
- 11.5% of children from middle-income families  
- 21.9% of children from low-income families  
fall into this category, indicating a **misallocation of talent** and a mechanism by which inequality persists across generations.

### *Intergenerational Self-Selection Model: The Influence of Fathersâ€™ and Mothersâ€™ Occupations on Childrenâ€™s Occupational Outcomes*  
*Journal of Applied Economics*

This paper applies the **self-selection framework** to compare the influence of mothersâ€™ and fathersâ€™ occupations on sonsâ€™ and daughtersâ€™ career outcomes.  
Findings show that:  
- **Sons** experience *positive self-selection* when following their fathersâ€™ occupations, especially in skilled, high-wage fields.  
- **Daughters** (and some sons) who follow their mothersâ€™ occupations in low-wage sectors such as service or farming often face *negative self-selection*â€”they would have earned more in alternative careers.

These results highlight the **gendered dynamics of occupational inheritance** and the structural inefficiencies it perpetuates in the labor market.

### *Intergenerational Transmission of Occupations in the USA*  
[ðŸ“„ View Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4919255){:target="_blank"}

This study uses **56,952 parentâ€“child pairs** from the PSID (1968â€“2001) to examine occupational inheritance across the full occupational spectrum, rather than rankings.  
- Occupational following is strongest at both extremes of the socioeconomic ladder.  
- Sons of professionals have a **32.1%** probability of entering the same field, while sons of service workers show a **25.8%** match rate.  

These findings show that inequality is reproduced not only through privilege but also through disadvantage, via **occupation-specific human capital** and **intangible barriers** such as soft skills.

### *Relationship between Intergenerational Mobility (IGM) and Economic Growth: Evidence from Cross-Country Data*  
[ðŸ“„ View Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4919306){:target="_blank"}

Extending **Aiyar and Ebeke (2019)**, this paper combines **GDIM 2021** and **All the Ginis 2019** datasets and applies a **dynamic panel System GMM** approach to address endogeneity.  
Key results:  
- Income inequality reduces growth more sharply in countries with *low intergenerational mobility*.  
- In high-mobility societies, this adverse effect is **substantially muted**.  

These findings stress that fostering **equality of opportunity** is as crucial as reducing income inequality itself.
